# Governance and Timelock

- Use OpenZeppelin **TimelockController** + a **Gnosis Safe** (or equivalent) as sole proposer/executor.
- Ownership of `SNRGToken`, `SelfRescueRegistry`, `SNRGStaking`, `SNRGPresale`, and `SNRGSwap` is transferred to the timelock.
- Minimum delay recommendation: **48â€“96 hours** for any sensitive action.
- No EOAs hold privileged roles. All changes occur with on-chain logs and enforced delay.
