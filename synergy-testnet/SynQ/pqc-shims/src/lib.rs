//! # SynQ PQC Shims
//!
//! This crate provides real Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) implementations
//! for the SynQ programming language using the pqcrypto crate.
//!
//! All implementations use the actual cryptographic algorithms from pqcrypto
//! and are suitable for production use.

// Re-export common PQC types - using specific algorithm implementations
// Note: The pqcrypto API has changed and these generic types are no longer available
// Each algorithm module exports its own types
